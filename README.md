# BlockTrace Take Home Challenge

## Things I would work on in the future/more time needed for
- css styling of table and chart
- separate the table and the form to be seperate components and pass data through the parent app.js
- More catches for null and undefined checks
- api limit so summary returns as "max call received" and breaks chart
- Loading state for when the data is being retrieved, looks very awkward with downtime between submit and data retrieved
- some small bugs and comments
